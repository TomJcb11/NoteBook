<h1>What is Immutable in Tuples?</h1>
<p>Unlike Python lists, tuples are immutable. Some Characteristics of Tuples in Python.
Like Lists, tuples are ordered and we can access their elements using their index values.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>We cannot update items to a tuple once it is created. Tuples cannot be appended or extended.We cannot remove items from a tuple once it is created.</p>
<p>So basicly what appends when you try to add more element inside of a tuple</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">tuple1= (1,2,3)
tuple2= (4,5,6)
print(f'the tuple1 is located at {id(tuple1)} and has value of {tuple1})')
tuple1+=tuple2
print(f'the tuple1 is located at {id(tuple1)} and has value of {tuple1})')
tuple1+=(7,8,9)
print(f'the tuple1 is located at {id(tuple1)} and has value of {tuple1})')
</code></pre>
<p>we can see that each time we update <code>tuple1</code> ,because a tuple is immutable you cannot directly update its value, python create a new tuple and reaffect the variable <code>tuple1</code> on it. but each time the id change</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">the tuple1 is located at 132873796386112 and has value of (1,2,3)
the tuple1 is located at 132873781472192 and has value of (1,2,3,4,5,6)
the tuple1 is located at 132873781493440 and has value of (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
the tuple1 is located at 132873782588608 and has value of (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
</code></pre>
<h2>Updating Tuple Values</h2>
<p>As explained above, we can't exactly update value of a tuple, in fact we recreate another objet of type tuple and the variable is now pointing to the new object. and the old one (no more used) go to the garbage collector.</p>
<h2>Unpack python tuple *args</h2>
<h3>Static Positionnal only</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">fruits = ('apple','banana','cherry')
(x, y, z) = fruits
print(y) #type str
</code></pre>
<h3>Dynamic Positionnal (x,*args)</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">fruits = ('apple','banana','cherry')
(x,*y) = fruits
print(y) #type list
</code></pre>
<h3>Another Dynamic Positionnal only (x,*args,y)</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">fruits = ('apple','banana','cherry','mango')
(x,*y, z) = fruits
print(y) #type list
</code></pre>
