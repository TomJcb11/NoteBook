<h1>python_set</h1>

<p>Here we can see how to initiate a Python set.</p>
<p>the id stays the same wich means the python set is mutable (you can update the value of the same object without making a new object)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">myset = {'apple','banana','cherry'}
print(f'the myset is located at {id(myset)} and has value of {myset})')
myset.remove('banana')  # remove 'banana' from the set
print(f'the myset is located at {id(myset)} and has value of {myset})')
myset.add('orange')  # add 'orange' to the set
print(f'the myset is located at {id(myset)} and has value of {myset})')
myset.add('orange')  # adding 'orange' again has no effect since sets do not allow duplicates
print(f'the myset is located at {id(myset)} and has value of {myset})')
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">the myset is located at 132873786581824 and has value of {'apple','cherry','banana'})
the myset is located at 132873786581824 and has value of {'apple','cherry'})
the myset is located at 132873786581824 and has value of {'apple','cherry','orange'})
the myset is located at 132873786581824 and has value of {'apple','cherry','orange'})
</code></pre>
<h2>adding elements to set</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python">myset.add(single item :int/str/float)
myset.update(multiple  item :list/tuple/set)
</code></pre>
<h2>removing elements from set</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python">myset.remove(value) #will raise an exeption if the key isnt found
myset.discard(value) #will erase the value if found nothing else 
myset.clear() #will purge every value of the set
del myset #will delete the set
</code></pre>
